** Build the website

Build the website using Nix:

#+begin_src bash
nix run .#deploy
#+end_src

The files are placed in ~./public~.

** Starting the development server

The development server compiles the pages, hot reloads them on any changes and
serves the files locally using hunchentoot. You can run just the server using Nix:

#+begin_src bash
nix run
#+end_src

Or simply load the ASDF system in the REPL and run:

#+begin_src lisp
(site:start)
#+end_src
